India has everything it needs to be a manufacturing powerhouse: a billion people, growing capital markets, supportive policy, and proximity to major markets. Yet we consistently fall short on execution.

## The 80/20 Problem

I've visited dozens of factories across India. The pattern is remarkably consistent: they can get to 80% of global quality standards relatively easily. It's the final 20% that seems impossibly hard.

That last 20% is where the real value lies. It's the difference between a product that's "good enough" and one that commands premium pricing. It's what separates contract manufacturing from building a brand.

## Where Things Break Down

**The shop floor skill gap.** India produces millions of engineering graduates, but few have ever touched a manufacturing line. The disconnect between academic training and factory floor reality is stark.

**Middle management bottleneck.** Scaling from one factory to ten requires a layer of middle managers who can independently make quality decisions. This talent pool barely exists.

**Compliance vs. improvement.** Most quality systems in Indian factories are designed to pass audits, not to drive continuous improvement. This creates a culture of checking boxes rather than solving problems.

**Supplier ecosystem fragility.** When your component suppliers can't hold tolerances, your final product can't either. India lacks the deep bench of precision suppliers that East Asian competitors have built over decades.

## What Would It Take?

Closing this gap requires patient, systematic investment in capabilities—not just capital equipment. Some threads I keep pulling on:

- Apprenticeship programs that actually work
- New models for building middle management talent
- Quality systems designed for learning, not compliance
- Industrial clusters that develop supplier ecosystems organically

The opportunity is massive. The question is whether we have the patience to build the foundations.
