Capital allocation looks different when you're operating in an emerging market. The frameworks that work in developed economies—where capital is abundant, institutions are stable, and markets are efficient—often fail in environments defined by scarcity and uncertainty.

## The Constraints Are Different

In developed markets, the primary constraint is usually competition. Capital is available; the question is how to deploy it better than rivals.

In emerging markets, the constraints are more fundamental:

- **Capital scarcity.** Cost of capital is higher, availability is lower
- **Institutional gaps.** Contracts may not be enforceable, property rights unclear
- **Information asymmetry.** Market data is sparse or unreliable
- **Infrastructure deficits.** You may need to build roads before you can build factories

These constraints don't just affect strategy—they define it.

## How Constraints Shape Strategy

**Vertical integration becomes necessary.** When you can't rely on suppliers or infrastructure, you build your own. This explains why successful emerging market companies often look bloated by developed market standards—they're solving problems that don't exist elsewhere.

**Patience becomes a competitive advantage.** Short-term capital seeks safer bets. If you can commit for the long term, you face less competition for the best opportunities.

**Relationships matter more than contracts.** When legal enforcement is weak, trust networks become critical. This is why family businesses and conglomerates dominate in many emerging economies.

**Optionality has more value.** Uncertainty is higher, so flexibility becomes precious. Investments that preserve optionality may be worth more than those that maximize expected value.

## The Capital Allocation Framework

When evaluating opportunities in emerging markets, I think about:

1. **What constraints am I solving for?** Be explicit about the binding constraints.
2. **What's my edge in navigating those constraints?** Local knowledge, relationships, patience?
3. **How does the opportunity change as constraints relax?** The best investments benefit from development, not fight it.
4. **What's my exit if constraints don't relax?** Always have a path that doesn't depend on everything going right.

The opportunity in emerging markets isn't despite the constraints—it's because of them. Constraints create barriers that protect those who can navigate them.
