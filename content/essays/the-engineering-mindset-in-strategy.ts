There's a particular way engineers think that I find undervalued in strategy work. It's not about technical skills—it's about a mental model for approaching problems.

## Frameworks vs. First Principles

Business education is largely about frameworks: Porter's Five Forces, the BCG Matrix, Jobs to Be Done. These are useful as starting points, but dangerous as ending points.

Frameworks compress knowledge into reusable patterns. They're efficient. But efficiency has a cost: frameworks work well in domains similar to where they were developed, and poorly everywhere else.

First-principles thinking is different. It starts from the ground up: What do we actually know? What are the real constraints? What are we actually trying to achieve?

This is how engineers think. Not "what framework applies here?" but "what's actually going on?"

## The Engineering Approach

**Decompose the problem.** Break complex problems into smaller, tractable pieces. Solve the pieces. Reassemble.

**Identify binding constraints.** Every system has constraints. Most are slack—they don't actually limit you. Find the ones that do.

**Build models, then test them.** Engineers build simplified models of reality, then test those models against data. The model is always wrong, but useful models are wrong in predictable ways.

**Iterate.** Don't try to get it right the first time. Build, test, learn, improve. Speed of iteration often matters more than quality of initial insight.

**Think in systems.** Individual components matter less than how they interact. Optimize the system, not the parts.

## Where This Matters Most

The engineering mindset is most valuable when:

- You're in a new domain where existing frameworks don't apply
- The problem has many interacting parts
- Feedback loops create non-obvious dynamics
- Execution matters as much as strategy

In other words: most situations that actually matter.

## Strategy as Engineering

The best strategists I know think like engineers. They're skeptical of pattern-matching, obsessive about understanding ground truth, and focused on building systems that work rather than plans that sound good.

The insight is simple: **strategy is engineering applied to business problems.** The mental models transfer directly.
