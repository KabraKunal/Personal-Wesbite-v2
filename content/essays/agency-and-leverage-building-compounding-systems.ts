Most people underestimate how much of their life is shaped by systems they didn't choose. The school you attended, the city you grew up in, the industry you fell into—these were often accidents of circumstance, not deliberate choices.

Agency is the ability to make those choices deliberate.

## The Compounding Question

Here's a question I return to often: **What am I building that will be more valuable in 10 years than it is today?**

Most activities don't compound. You watch a movie, you enjoy it, it's done. You scroll social media, nothing accumulates. Even most work—meetings, emails, routine tasks—leaves no lasting trace.

But some things compound dramatically:

- **Relationships** deepen with repeated interaction and shared experience
- **Skills** build on each other, enabling increasingly complex work
- **Knowledge** connects and creates new insights
- **Reputation** opens doors that were previously invisible
- **Capital** (financial, social, intellectual) can be reinvested

## Building Systems

The insight is that you can *systematize* compounding. Instead of relying on willpower or motivation, you can build structures that make the right behaviors automatic.

A few principles I've found useful:

**Default to writing.** Writing forces clarity. Published writing compounds—it's findable, shareable, and attracts people who think similarly.

**Build in public.** Sharing your work creates accountability and attracts feedback. The discomfort is the point.

**Invest in relationships asymmetrically.** Spend more time with people who challenge you, less with those who merely validate you.

**Create before you consume.** Consumption is easy and feels productive. Creation is hard and actually is productive.

## Agency as Foundation

None of this works without agency—the deep belief that your choices matter and that you can shape your circumstances.

Agency isn't something you have or don't have. It's something you practice. Every time you make a deliberate choice instead of drifting, you strengthen the muscle.

The question isn't whether you have agency. It's whether you're exercising it.
